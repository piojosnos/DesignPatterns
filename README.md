I wrote this code around 2009 to explain several design patterns
when I was teaching Software Engineering at Universidad de Los Andes.
It is a small toy that shows several things:

1. How to put together some windows in good and old Swing.
2. How to do some custom components, custom drawing, mouse handling, etc.
3. How to so some interesting patterns: Command (to do undo/redo), plugin, etc.

This is very old code, that I'm making public to share and explain
some concepts to a couple of mentees I'm working with. I don't know how
good it will work for you, I've forgotten a lot of how it worked, and
I'm sure it could be improved... after all, it has been more than 16 years
since I wrote this.
